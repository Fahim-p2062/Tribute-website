        Dr. Muhammad Yunus, born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is an economist, social entrepreneur, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. He is best known for founding Grameen Bank in 1983 and pioneering microcreditâ€”providing small, collateral-free loans to impoverished individuals, especially women, to help them start businesses and escape poverty. His innovative approach transformed traditional banking and empowered millions, proving that even the poorest could be financially responsible.
        In 2006, Dr. Yunus and Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in combating poverty. Beyond microfinance, Yunus has championed social business, promoting enterprises designed to solve social problems sustainably. His work has had a global impact, influencing similar microfinance institutions worldwide. Through his books and advocacy, Dr. Yunus continues to inspire efforts toward financial inclusion and poverty reduction across the globe.
